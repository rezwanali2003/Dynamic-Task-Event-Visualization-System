# Dynamic Task & Event Visualization System

## Overview
This project provides a Python-based solution to dynamically fetch and display current and upcoming tasks and events from Google Calendar and Google Tasks. The system continuously updates and sets your desktop wallpaper to display these events, allowing you to have a constant visual reminder of your schedule. The tool is especially useful for individuals who prefer having their agenda easily accessible and visible at all times.

## Features
- **Real-Time Task & Event Display:** Automatically updates every 10 seconds to show the most current tasks and events.
- **Countdown Timer:** Displays a countdown for upcoming events to help you manage your time more effectively.
- **Time Zone Compatibility:** Adjusts to your local time zone (e.g., IST) to ensure event times are accurate.
- **Customizable Layout:** Tasks and events are displayed in a clean, centered layout on a black background.
- **Lightweight and Efficient:** Designed to run in the background with minimal system resource usage.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6+
- pip (Python package installer)
- Required Python libraries: `Pillow`, `ctypes`, `win32con`, `google-auth`, `google-api-python-client`, `pytz`
- Google API Credentials (for Calendar and Tasks API)

### Steps
1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dynamic-task-event-visualization.git
    cd dynamic-task-event-visualization
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**

    ```sh
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Obtain Google API credentials:**
   - Create a project on the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
   - Enable the Google Calendar API and Google Tasks API.
   - Download the `credentials.json` file and save it in the project directory.

## Usage

### Fetching Events & Tasks
To fetch and display tasks and events, simply run the main script. The system will generate a wallpaper image with the events and tasks listed, and set it as your desktop background.

```sh
python main.py
```

### Customization
- **Resolution:** The script is set to generate a 1920x1080 resolution wallpaper. You can adjust the resolution by modifying the `width` and `height` variables in the script.
- **Font Size:** Adjust the font size to better fit your screen by changing the `font_large` and `font_small` sizes in the script.
- **Update Interval:** The wallpaper updates every 10 seconds by default. This can be changed by modifying the `time.sleep(10)` line in the main loop.
